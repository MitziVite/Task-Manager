# Overview

I made this project for learning more about C++. I developed a task management system that allows users to create, edit, delete, and save tasks, where I was able to use my knowledge on object-oriented programming concepts in C++.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used VS Code for my development environment. The language was C++

I used the libraries of <iostream>, <fstream>, and <vector>, which facilitated user input/output and data storage in text files.
